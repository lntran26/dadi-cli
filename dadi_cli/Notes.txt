Notes

Ug... Had to reinstall everything!
Let's clean up my examples and testing protocol.
test_bench.py seems to work with 2 GPUs, in a similar work pattern to what dadi-cli uses

# Test command... This small data set shouldn't be faster with GPU
dadi-cli InferDM --fs ./examples/results/fs/1KG.YRI.CEU.20.synonymous.snps.unfold.fs --model split_mig --lbounds 1e-3 1e-3 0 0 0 --ubounds 100 100 1 10 0.5  --output ./examples/results/demo/1KG.YRI.CEU.20.split_mig.demo.params --optimizations 10 --maxeval 20 --seed 12345

test_cpu.sh
4099693

test_gpu.sh
4099694
Crashing with 
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::invalid_argument'
  what():  wrong algorithm string"

This seems to be a C++ error. Where could this be coming from? And is it happening at the beginning or end? 
First check, am I getting output files? Save output to --output ./examples/results/demo/1KG.YRI.CEU.20.split_mig.demo.gpu.params

* I need to debug this on our kids desktop to start with... *
Create new gpu branch I can work in...
Outputs are happening!

* Huh, seeds may not be working properly... *
