MissingOutputException in line 29 of /xdisk/rgutenk/xinhuang/projects/dadi-cli/examples/snakemake/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds:
1KG.YRI.three_epoch_1d.bestfit.demo.params
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Job id: 1 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 1
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
