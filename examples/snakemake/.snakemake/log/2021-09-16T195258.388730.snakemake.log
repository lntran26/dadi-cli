Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 20 of /home/kaiser/Documents/projects/dadi-cli/examples/snakemake/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds:
1KG.YRI.three_epoch_1d.demo.params.InferDM.opts.1
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Job id: 2 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 2
Removing output files of failed job dadi_infer_dm since they might be corrupted:
1KG.YRI.three_epoch_1d.demo.params.InferDM.opts.0
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
